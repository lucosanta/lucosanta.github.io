							<h3>Bio</h3>
								<p>Luca was born in Cattolica (IT) on 25th May 1992.
								It is a SW Engineer which currently lives in Modena (IT). 
								He got <i>Software Engineer Bachelor Degree</i> in 2014 and <i>Computer Science and Engineering Master Degree</i> in 2017.</p>
								<p>He has started his career in <a href="http://www.technogym.com" target="_blank">Technogym</a> where he has completed an Internship as <strong>Web Developer</strong>.</p>
								<p>Then he moved to <a href="http://www.tecla.it" target="_blank">Tecla Digital Business</a> where he had the role as <strong>Junior Java Developer</strong>. </p>
								<p>After six month he moved to <a href="http://www.teoresigroup.com/" target="_blank">Teoresi SPA</a> as Software Engineer designing and developing MATLAB/Python solutions for customers which requires it.</p>
								<p>He has fallen in love with Robotics and Machine Learning fields. He is currently spending most of his spare time to learn from Coursera courses in order to fill his losses and gain as much as he can in the Deep Learning field. 
									Moreover, it tries some of the algorithm learned in Kaggle Competitions to prove his ability in the field against many of the most brilliant mind in data science.</p>
								<p>He loves programming. His favourite programming language is Python which knows very well thanks to working experiences and Master Thesis implementations.</p>

							<h3>Bachelor's thesis - Android library for P2P ad-hoc communications based on Libreria per comunicazioni ad-hoc per android basate su bluetooth</h3>
							<p><i>Disclaimer: This thesis was implemented in 2014 with Bluetooth 3.0</i></p>
							<p><i>It is possible to read the thesis <a href="http://amslaurea.unibo.it/7988/">here</a> (Italian language).</i></p>
  							<p>This work is meant to develop an Android library that lets you communicate among different mobile devices using Bluetooth technology.</p>
							<p>This library is able to manage automatically any type of connections either it comes from other either it is started by device itself.</p>
							<p>It is able to manage the dynamics of the system using mobile devices, updating and highlightning in real time the neighbour devices list. It has been developed using P2P (Peer to Peer) network architecture.</p> 
							<p>The P2P feature is not part of Android library but it has been developed a library layer to mask the Master-Slave architecture (which is typical of the Bluetooth technology). The library is able to recognize not only its neighbour but also the neighbour of the neighbour and so on.</p>
							<p>One of the most interesting features that has been implemented is the ability to create a network of communication. The only issues found relies on Bluetooth technology which is not able to support more than 7 devices at the same time. </p>

							<h3>Master's thesis - A comparison among Deep Learning techniques in an autonomous driving context</h3>
							<p><i>Disclaimer: This thesis was implemented in 2017</i></p>
							<p><i>Thesis is currently not available.</i></p>
							<p>The recent advances in computational power of processors have opened up
								new opportunities for computational intelligence methods. The potential of
								algorithms known from decades but still not implemented has been unleashed
								owing to these recent computational improvements.</p>
							<p>These advancements in computational power favoured the expansion of
								artificial intelligence to domains that were confined to fiction movies in the
								past.</p>
							<p>One of these wonders that has always fed the imagination and dreams
								of many people is the <strong>autonomous car</strong> . In the 80â€™s TV series like Knight
								Rider have predicted the possibilities in the near future of such technologies.
								Nowadays, technology newspapers and blogs are filled by article about how
								it works but they never go in much detail. The main reason is that car
								manufactures have always avoided to disclose their secrets.</p>
							<p>Many automotive company and researchers are spending more and more time on these technologies.
								In this thesis, I have described many of these researches and the state-of-art of autonomous driving.
							<p>Technologies, programming languages and simulators are compared in order to find the best suited methods to accomplish a simple
								task like the Lane Following task. Starting from classical computer vision algorithms and going to Neural Networks, I have described android
								tried many algorithms in order to understand which one fits the best. Deep Learning techniques are compared. I have trained CNN and CNN+LSTM 
								using the supervised learning. I have trained a car to drive using a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm like A3C in CARLA simulator (like illustrated in the picture of the section). 
								A3C has demonstrated to be very promising in an interactive task like Lane Following one but the assumption of a simulated environments 
								where each of the signals could be exploited seems not to be like the real world. In fact, one of the suggested future developments is the possibility to help a Deep Neural Network to learn to drive 
								using an human assistance and calculating a reward from the human instead of a simulator in order to let the car learn faster from a real experience as we do when we start driving with a driving instructor.
								This may be another step towards the real autonomous driving.
