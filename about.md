  <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>Luca was born in Cattolica (IT) on 25th May 1992.
    It is a SW Engineer which currently lives in Modena (IT). 
    He got <i>Software Engineer Bachelor Degree</i> in 2014 and <i>Computer Science and Engineering Master Degree</i> in 2017.</p>
    <p>He has started his career in <a href="http://www.technogym.com" target="_blank">Technogym</a> where he has completed an Internship as <strong>Web Developer</strong>.</p>
    <p>Then he moved to <a href="http://www.tecla.it" target="_blank">Tecla Digital Business</a> where he had the role as <strong>Junior Java Developer</strong>. </p>
    <p>After six month he moved to <a href="http://www.teoresigroup.com/" target="_blank">Teoresi SPA</a> as Software Engineer designing and developing MATLAB/Python solutions for customers which requires it.</p>
    <p>He has fallen in love with Robotics and Machine Learning fields. He is currently spending most of his spare time to learn from Coursera courses in order to fill his losses and gain as much as he can in the Deep Learning field. Moreover, it tries some of the algorithm learned in Kaggle Competitions to prove his ability in the field against many of the most brilliant mind in data science.</p>
    <p>He loves programming. His favourite language is Python which knows very well thanks to working experiences and Master Thesis implementations.</p>
